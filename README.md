# leagueApp

This was a way to look up statistics on yourself and your opponents when playing League of Legends. A bunch of stuff would appear once you had looked up someone in a game. Now the servers don't allow for this and it doesn't work.

This is just an example for how to do a GUI now.

Just to date this, this was done in Feb, 2015, so many of the champion pictures are out of date.
